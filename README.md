## Usage

The timed code quiz begins after the start button is pressed and there are multiple choice questions, to be answered by selecting one of four buttons, accompanied by sound effects when an answer is selected. There is a different sound depending on whether the answer is correct or not.

The quiz is to be completed within the time limit. However, selecting the wrong answer reduces the remaining time by 10 seconds. The code quiz ends when the user has either answered all the questions or the time has run out. The score is then displayed and there is a text box to input the user’s initials. 

Once the initials have been entered, the high scores page is displayed. If the user’s score is within the top ten scores, it will be displayed on the page. From this page, there is the option to clear the high scores table or to go back to return to the quiz and play again.
